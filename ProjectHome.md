## Sequential Monte Carlo ##

We provide a novel Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to integrate the posterior distribution of a Bayesian variable selection problem. The code used for the numerical work in _Sequential Monte Carlo on large binary sampling spaces_ is contained in the package _ibs_.

We provide a novel Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to stochastically optimize pseudo-Boolean functions. The code used for the numerical work in _Particle algorithms for optimization on binary spaces_ is contained in the package _obs_.

## Installation ##

The python project for sequential Monte Carlo on binary spaces is available in the  [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/smcdss/downloads/list) section. Currently the project configuration is done using a documented text file. We are going to provide a graphical interface within the next weeks in order to make the software more easily accessible. Therefore, the [installation guide](install.md) is still incomplete.

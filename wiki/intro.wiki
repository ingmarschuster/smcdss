#summary User manual

== Getting started ==

The project comes with some example data sets and launch-files. We can for instance launch a Bayesian variable selection on the covariates of the Boston Housing dataset via
{{{
ibs -r boston
}}}
The program (unzipped in a folder PROJECT_PATH) first loads the default configurations from
{{{
PROJECT_PATH/src/ibs/default.ini
}}}
The launch configuration file _boston.ini_ is found in the run path RUN_PATH=data/test_ibs. The values in
{{{
PROJECT_PATH/RUN_PATH/boston.ini
}}}
override the default values. The program opens the indicated data file DATA_SET=boston in the data path DATA_PATH=data/bvs
{{{
PROJECT_PATH/DATA_PATH/DATA_SET/DATA_SET.csv
}}}
The results of the test run are stored in the run path RUN_PATH=data/test_ibs
{{{
PROJECT_PATH/RUN_PATH/DATA_SET/results.csv
}}}

Modifications are made by editing the launch files. The _default.ini_ is well documented and should be self-explanatory in combination with the [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.6037 literature].

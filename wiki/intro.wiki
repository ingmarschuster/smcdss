#summary User manual

== Getting started ==

The project comes with some example data sets and launch-files. We can launch a Bayesian variable selection on the covariates of the Boston Housing dataset via
{{{
ibs -r boston
}}}
The program looks for the config file
{{{
$project/data/test_int/boston.ini
}}}
and opens the indicated data file
{{{
$project/data/bvs/boston/boston.csv
}}}
The results of the test run are stored in
{{{
$project/data/test_int/boston/results.csv
}}}

Modifications are made by editing the launch files. These are copies of the standard file
{{{
$project/src/ibs/default.ini
}}}
and override the default values. The default.ini is well documented and should be self-explanatory in combination with the [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.6037 literature].

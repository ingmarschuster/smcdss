== External packages ==

The project uses several external packages.
  * [http://www.scipy.org/ SciPy and NumPy] for scientific computing and fast array manipulations.
  * [http://www.parallelpython.com/ Parallel Python] for parallelized computing.
  * [http://cython.org Cython] for C-extensions to speed up some loops

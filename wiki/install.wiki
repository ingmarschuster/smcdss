== Linux ==

The Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is written in Python 2.7 and requires several auxiliary modules that come with the project.

 * Download the project and unzip where ever you like. Let's call the path of the folder PROJECT_PATH.
 
 * Open the file
 {{{
 PROJECT_PATH/bin/ibs.sh
 }}}
 and set the entry PROJECT_PATH to the path of the project folder.

 * For convenience, create a symbolic link
 {{{
 sudo ln -s $HOME/PROJECT_PATH/bin/ibs.sh /usr/local/sbin/ibs
 }}}

 }}}
 and set the entry _PROJECT_ to the path of the project folder.

== External packages ==

The project uses several external packages that need to be installed.
  * [http://www.scipy.org/ SciPy and NumPy] for scientific computing and fast array manipulations.
  * [http://www.parallelpython.com/ Parallel Python] for parallelized computing.
  * [http://cython.org Cython] for C-extensions to speed up some loops.

#summary Installation guide

== Graphical User Interface ==

In order to simplify the parameterization, we decided to provide a GUI that will be available soon.

== External packages ==

The Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is written in Python 2.6 and requires several auxiliary modules.

The project uses several external packages that need to be installed.
  * [http://www.scipy.org/ SciPy and NumPy] for scientific computing and fast array manipulations.
  * [http://www.parallelpython.com/ Parallel Python] for parallelized computing.
  * [http://cython.org Cython] for C-extensions to speed up some loops.

## Graphical User Interface ##

In order to simplify the parameterization, we decided to provide a GUI that will be available soon.

## External packages ##

The Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is written in Python 2.6 but requires several external packages that need to be installed.

  * [SciPy and NumPy](http://www.scipy.org/) for scientific computing and fast array manipulations.
  * [Parallel Python](http://www.parallelpython.com/) for parallelized computing.
  * [Cython](http://cython.org) for C-extensions to speed up some loops.
